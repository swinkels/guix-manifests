This repo contains the files required to (re)build my Guix profiles:

- default :: specifies the main Guix profile of my main workstation. It comes
  without Guix channel specification so it is not reproducible.
- baringa :: specifies the Python development container I used for a my
  customers.
- python-3.11 :: specifies the content of a Guix profile for Python 3.11.

Each subdirectory contains a README that describes how to install that profile.
